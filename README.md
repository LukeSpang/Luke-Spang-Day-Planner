# Luke-Spang-Day-Planner

Have you ever written down your schedule for the day on a note pad or sticky note, and then misplaced it? All of those plans, GONE! You probably wrote them down because you were forgetful. Now there's no way you can remember what you were going to do. 

Well fret not, because this simple work day planner application will help to keep your busy day organized and saved. Some of the features of this application include...

1. The current date displayed at the top of the page.
2. Time blocks for standard business hour (9AM to 5PM).
3. Color coded blocks to differentiate between past, present, and future.
4. Areas in each timeblock to enter event, as well as a button to save events.
5. Events are saved to local storage and persist on the page, even when refreshed. 

BONUS FEATURES!

1. A reset/clear button at the top of the page. This will clear local storage and refresh the page. A confirm prompt will come up when this option is selected. If confirmed the page will be cleared. If declined, nothing will happen. 
2. An alert comes up whenever the save button is clicked, to inform users that the information was indeed saved. 

The application can be seen below in screen shots and also be viewed live at
